# Film Rental Performance Analysis using SQL & Tableau

## Project Summary
This project analyzes a relational film rental database using **SQL for data extraction, transformation, and KPI development**, and **Tableau for interactive dashboarding and insight communication**. The goal is to convert raw transactional data into business-ready insights that support decisions related to revenue performance, customer behavior, film demand, and store operations.

## Problem Statement
Transactional databases store large volumes of operational data but are not directly usable for business decision-making. This project addresses that gap by using SQL to create analytical datasets and Tableau to visualize key performance indicators, enabling stakeholders to quickly understand trends, identify top-performing films, and evaluate store-level performance.

## Dataset Description
The project uses a relational film rental database containing multiple interconnected tables, including:
- Film
- Category
- Inventory
- Rental
- Payment
- Customer
- Store

The data structure supports complex joins and aggregations required for analytical reporting.
